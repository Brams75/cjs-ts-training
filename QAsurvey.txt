3. What is the difference between an API unit test and a UI acceptance test ?

The api unit test allows us to check if some functionality of the api works as it should. Do not need to simulate clicks, types ... of the user and save time on tests.
Example: I can test a GET request to check if I can get the data, or if It fail.

A User Interface Acceptance Testing allows us to verify that the parts of the application that the user interacts with work as they should.
Example: We test a specific case when the user should click on termsAndConditions, and we want to verify if he is redirected on this page or he is not.
